 == Citations == 

 Discussion for improvement should be on talk pages rather than in the article. Here the text about citations recently added: 
 :Citation: The Rydeian, the School Magazine, is published yearly: but there is no """"online"""" version of it for this period, but it does exist in """"hard copy"""" and the School does keep copies of all their magazines in their Archives. 
 :Every year, the Headmaster addresses the School at Speech Day, some time in September, and the record of this speech is placed in the yearly magazine, The Rydeian. The Headmaster's Speech of September 2002 is of particular note because the son of the Founders, Roy McIsaac, is paid tribute, and it was Roy McIsaac who had helped to save the school in the 1950s when it faced a crisis. 
 Citations do not have to be available online but they should be verifiable. This is normally interpreted as publicly accessible in libraries or archives. If copies are not lodged in the local library (I'm not sure that the school archive is a suitable public archive), it may be worth confirming with the school if they would like to make electronic or scanned versions available for free release on Commons. It should be noted that a school magazine is considered a self-published source and so not a suitable reference to re-quote information from other sources (such as school statistics available from independent regulating authorities). When including quotations, please note the guidelines of WP:QUOTEFARM. Thanks,   """

 == Citing the First Amendment == 

 The Wikipedia article should start with a plain citation of the first amendment before launching into a breakdown of its components or any explanation of the amendment. 

 The article should start by saying:  

 The first amendment to the Constitution of the United States is,  

 """"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."""" 

 Citation: The Constitution of The United States 

 Not doing so fails to allow the reader to interpret and judge the discussion in full knowledge of the amendment itself. I can see no good reason for creating such a situation, and can easily see how it opens the door to those who wish to persuade the reader to adopt a particular interpretation, lacking reference to the amendment itself. 

 Why open that door. Start by stating the amendment. That is what the article is about."""

 ; From the Members 
 Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter! Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do.   

 I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity. I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue. By the end of the month, I hope to have the main category list finished (yeah, it might take that long, it's huge). At that time, I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue. Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is, and how to deal with the non-qualifying categories, on the General Forum page.

 *6. Daimler Conquest Roadster / Mark II Drophead Coupe open two seater / wind-up sidewindows and therefore a dhc or convertible,  a more civilised Roadster. I can find no useful info about this except it must have been forgotten by April 1959 when the Dart (became the SP250) was announced in April 1959 and that too, just the way the Roadster was at first, was Unbelievably crude.

 've been reading this talk page and I was amazed by the way some people are ready to make such a violent debate about issues they seem not to know the basis of what they're talking about. I may understand that some of the contributors to this discussion do not know a world of arabic, but that is a shame when discussing the work of someone (antoun saadeh) who wrote mainly in arabic (his complete works is a 17 volume series of around 200 page each, and cover a nearly 30 years of writing) and a party whose intellectuals (at least 4 generations) have a massive production of memoires, and doctrinal discussions (to name a few concerning memoirs Abdallah koberssi, Jebran Jreij,Julia el mir-saadeh, Ibrahim yamout, Mahmoud Nehme... for doctrinal discussions Said Taki el dinne, Wassim zeineddine, Nassif Nassar, Enaam Raed, Aboud Aboud...). I think some due clarifications are to be made: 1- concerning racism and Nazi claims: a) back in 1934, when he was in french mandate jails and when the Reich was at his peak and eugenism was still in vogue in Europe and America, Saadeh wrote one of the most central books in his doctrine """"The Rise of Nations"""", in the second chapter of the book he makes - based on a well referenced scientific anthropological findings and other writings regarding the development of national identity in Europe - a solid case against races' superiority claim (he clearly defines social interaction between different people of different origin and culture as basis to any real development in human history) and underline that linking nationalism to racism (in taking examples not only of Germany but also of France and Europe in early 18th century) is a very reactionary and dangerous position, that should be combatted in the Arab Levant a land of strong diversity. b) On the other hand it is well known - and referenced, even Pipes and Hitchens would agree so - that SSNP followers are form very different religious (of very diverse sects) and ethnic (arabs, but also kurds, armenians, greeks, turks, persians, franks...) origins. And they might be with some communist parties in the region the very few who could proclaim such a diversity, Hardly a case for racism c) concerning the alleged saadeh's anti-arabs positions. It is striking thow some get to such a conclusion, when one of the 4 core objectives of the party clearly stated in its Goal, is the cration of a pan-arab front. saadeh defended what he called """"true arabism"""", in his view a realistic, operative version of arabism capable of mobilizing development and resistance to colonial and then Zionist threts. He attacked conventional arabism (claiming a one Nation from Mauritania to the comores ilands, and mainly based on the sole lingual link, and the arab islamic culture negating all minority cultures). That does not mean that Saadeh's position is an anti-arab cultural position but that of considering the arab golden era of the middle ages as part of a longer history going from antiquity to present days, building a certain """"geographic culture"""" in a certain geographic territory that is in his view the Fertile Crescent. He sees his Greater Syria and his party as one of the forces in the rise of the Arab World. c) most importantly his social nationalism doctrine is contradictory to any racism or even any chauvinism - that he denounces plainly in his writings. His conception of nationalism has at its core two central founding dynamics """"social interaction"""" and """"territorial interaction"""". The """"Moutahhad"""" is his elementary social and territorial unit, it is considered to be the territorial scale in which basic needs (mainly security, food, shelter and community) could be achieved via social interaction. there is different level of Moutahads incorporating linked nets of smaller Moutahds, and responding to different level of human needs ( As a exemple a village or a town quarter is an elementery Moutahad, a territorial region or a metropolis is a different level of Moutahad incorporating a network of villages or of quarters...). The """"Watan"""" or """"Patrie"""" is the Nation level territorial Moutahad. For Saadeh beeing part of a Moutahad is a simple choice to live in it, and committing ones future to its, regardless of racial, cultural or religious origin. Of course left by itself and ruled by reactionary exclusive cultures set on primary social bodies (clans, tribes, large families, religious groups...), such a space holding great potentials for development will turn out to be a battlefield of tribes and flags, and a backyard for colonial exploitation. That's where he think his Nahda, a Cultural and Political Renaissance is needed to bring in a more liberal modernist spirit - in opposition to the racist Toranic movement of Ataturk or the Fascist approach of Mussolini, he thought to do it not by deneing the multicultural status of the Levant and consider rich with heritage, and by proving in his writings, that none of these cultures are fundamentally racis"
