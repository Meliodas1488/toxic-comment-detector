fec6961acc20d82e,"I have just followed from your edit exchange on the article Blu-Ray Disc to find the exchange above.  Sadly, you appear to know little about the subject, and to be fair, it has become confusing because much of the terminology has become abused.

First, European Blu-Ray discs are not produced in 24p format.   That is almost exclusively the preserve of the American regions.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray format does not support the proper 1080 progressive high definition formats (1080/50p and 1080/60p (and I include the 59.95p in that).  This is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats.  The European sourced discs that state 1080p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive.  The term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order, 

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... 1078 - 1079 -1080.  

Alternatively, there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first (odd field) and then follows them by the even lines (even field). (You probably know this already).

1 - 3 - 5 - 7 ... 1077 - 1079 - 2 - 4 - 6 ... 1078 - 1080

They are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format's origins in the NTSC world.  In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.

There is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.

When film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.

Once we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.  

The result was the 24p format.  The only problem with the 24p format is that if you try to watch it on a CRT display (and A CRT is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction), the result will be unviewable to bad flicker - something that was known as long ag",1,0,0,0,0,0

Search: Corporate Blacklisted engineer

   

I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for almost 20 years collectively for the following companies; Pratt and Whitney, Williams International, Ford Motor Company, and as a contract engineer for Compuware d/b/a Professional Services at Chrysler Corporation in Auburn Hills, Mi. It is the latter two to which I am forging my complaint as they told prospective employers, my private investigator and my newspaper reporter, that I was not employed by them, thus blacklisting me, and preventing from all future employment.

 

I believe that they did this to me because I found fault with one of Chrysler’s automotive designs that could have resulted in a safety issue, that they did not want to fix and it was easier and cheaper to get rid of me.

 

I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington, DC and in Boston’s Federal court ….all courts denied me justice. A lawyer representing Chrysler offered me $1000 to settle the case about 2 years ago which I refused since I felt it was like a slap in the face compared to the injustice they have caused me.

 

Your viewing of my video will greatly help to end my 11 yrs of homelessness by increasing public awareness of my case and consequently, will send Chrysler, Compuware and combustion components a direct message that I am not giving up and refuse to go quietly into the night.

How should this be done? Netflix's releases for May just came up, and the other 13 episodes of season 2 are listed as May 29th release... only they'll be released as Season 3.

So do we label them as Season 3, as Netflix, an official distributor labels them as such, and simply label them as production codes 214-226, or do we label them as season 2, with an addendum stating Netflix released them as a third season?

Obviously we have a few weeks, but figure getting a collective agreement on what to do now is better. 99.162.156.148",1,0,0,0,0,0

I find it telling that neither of you had the courtesy to respond to my proposal and K3 went ahead to begin editing the article without any consensus being reached. Let the record note that I am now compelled to reciprocate your actions and make my suggested changes. JJ obviously lacks any serious knowledge in this area and was only here for circumventing 3RR, so there's no point answering his most recent underinformed questions. I'll focus on Kautilya3. If you were significantly acquainted with the topic, you would understand that the Kakatiyas were feudatories of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty.So the question of when the formal royal dynasty began is a natural question, not """"patent nonsense"""", and probably one of the reasons some previous editor changed the old date to """"Uncertain"""". 1053 was the date given for the first royal inscription based on the permanent grant of Hanumakonda (their original capital for your edification) as a fief to the Kakatiyas. I also suggest you both refresh your knowledge of WP:Civility, to improve the quality of your current and future discussions. If you don't know about an author, here's a hint, ask...politely..rather than first disrespectfully dismissing the author, then demanding his c.v. What's more, his book speaks for itself. Its the History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh (the old state which included the new state of Telangana). This is not some arcane ivory tower speculative paper, but a WP:RS. So if you want to change the date to 956CE, perfectly fine by me. The only difference is, I had the sense of responsibility to provide a citation. I suggest you do the same. 

Let me repeat that I am perfectly fine with having a respectful dialogue. But as I've said before, it takes two hands to clap. Ball is in your court, gentlemen.

The arbcom having read the evidence are now voting to thank her - so it is a very valid question. Kelly always implied she was a friend of Jimbo's.  Good for her, that must be very pleasant for them both.  However, I can't imagine Jimbo was particularly impressed by that blog either.

I don't imagine Jimbo is much impressed by me or many others concerned with whole rotten case either, but it's all a bit late for those concerns now. Now this is actually Bishonen's page, so my further views will be posted on my own page, if I decide to post them that is, because I too am heartily sick of this whole case, it is just a pity reference to that blog was ever permitted as evidence, especially if people do not in fact want to discuss it or here concerned parties views on it.

 Auto guides and the motoring press are not good sources for an encyclopedia article about """"luxury vehicle"""". This is because automakers feed the press a lot of BS (Boastful Superlatives) who then work hard to write articles adding even more BS to describe their products. The press earns credits from the hands that feed them. Add to this the fact that potential and actual purchasers of luxury vehicles have an insatiable  appetite  for this type of BS. Classifying a particular vehicle as """"luxury"""" is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial. Using self-serving BS in marketing claims is a very, very old invention that helps sell products, as well as fuel the fan base with """"bragging"""" rights to which vehicles are """"luxury"""". On the other hand, it is more difficult for most marketers to be humble and genuine. That is why an encyclopedia article has to avoid falling into the trap of using traditional marketing superlatives and hyperbole. —   """,1,0,0,0,0,0
